Your assignment **will not** be marked unless you have completed this statement.

## Statement of Originality

I declare that the work I have submitted for assignment one is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:


* The idea of transfering string to char array and compare them after sorting is referred to the method introduction in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html.

* The idea of converting char array to string is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8172420/how-to-convert-a-char-to-a-string.

* The idea of using Class Stringbuilder to append char into a char array comes from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17568588/char-array-appending-in-java.
