Review Comments:

1. RailroadInk.java:401 Correctly used the method from 311-372 and simplified the main method of task 6.

2. Exit.java:47-50 Lack of the operation of exits on the left and the upper edges at first, but this was corrected after finishing the ExitTest.java.

3. RailroadInk.java:162 Correctly implemented the method to detect the illegal connection of the dice, but this method can be replaced by method "areConnectedNeighbours" in 103.

4. RailroadInk.java:550 Good to use "try" and "catch" to edit the dice roll with valid placement of the dice roll.
