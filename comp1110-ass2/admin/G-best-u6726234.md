I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method getBasicScore() in class RailroadInk.
* The method placeTileOnBoard() in class Board.
* The method initGraphs() in class Score.
* The class Layers and its inheritance: class StringViewer, singleBoard and Competeboard. 

I declare that this is entirely my own work.
