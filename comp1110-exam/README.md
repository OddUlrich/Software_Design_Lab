# COMP1110/1140/6710 End-Of-Year Exam

This repo contains an IntelliJ project that you can use as
 part of the **sample** end-of-year exam.
 
 You will find the sample exam [here](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/exam/sample/1110-exam.html).

You will find six questions in the exam.  Among these, questions, 1,
3, 4, and 5 have coding elements, totalling eight (sub)questions, and
for each of these you will find a separate Java class with FIXME notes
indicating what you need to do.  The number of marks per question varies.
There is one unit test provided for each question with which you may
test your answer.   If a question is worth five marks, you will find 
that there are five unit tests.

 Important notes:
 * The exam will be **entirely auto-graded**, so it is important that your code passes the tests.
 * The exam may be graded against (slightly) different tests.
 * The exam will not involve git.  
 * **You must copy your code into your exam in your browser**.
 * In the exam, the state of your exam within your web browser is **continuously saved** (you don't need
 to press a save button).
