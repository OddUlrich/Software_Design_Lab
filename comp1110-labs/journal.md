## Personal Journal

Each student must maintain a very simple personal journal.

#### Why

Your journal is a simple, low-overhead mechanism for getting you to be
_reflective_, to think _deliberately_ and _systematically_ about your
progress in this course, and for you to communicate
that to your tutor.

#### When

From week two onwards, you need to **commit and push** your journal at least
**_five minutes before_** your scheduled lab time.  Thoughtfully completing the
journal is a requirement of the course and what's committed prior to your scheduled
lab will be assessed by your tutor and reflected in your class engagement mark.

#### What

Each week, **starting in week one**, you need to **fill in the table** below to answer five very simple
questions:
* Respond to the statement '**Overall, I am happy with how I am going in this course**' (`1` strongly disagree, `2` disagree, `3` neutral, `4` agree, `5` strongly agree).
* Respond to the statement '**Overall, my assignment group is working well**' (`1` strongly disagree, `2` disagree, `3` neutral, `4` agree, `5` strongly agree) (week 4 onwards).
* **What have I done** for this class in the week to date?
* **What will I do** for this class in the week to come?
* **What impediments do I see** to me making progress on my goals?

This is based loosely on the [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
methodology often used in software engineering.   Your statements need only be  _brief_,
but they should be _carefully considered_.

The statements should be written with respect to the weeks before and after your
scheduled lab time.   The journal serves three purposes.   First, it helps *you* to be
deliberate and self-reflective about how you think you are doing in the course.   Second,
it helps your tutor understand how you're doing, making them better able to *help you*.
Third, it helps your lecturer understand how the whole class is doing, making him better
able to *help the whole class*.

**Thoughtful** and **concise** entries are best.

| Week | Going Well? (1-5) | Group OK? (1-5) | What I have done | What I will do | What impedes me |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| 1 |4|-| setuped configuration in my laptop, built the file constructure and finish tasks in week 1 | finish tasks in week 2 and preview javaFX | low familiarity and conflicts in configuration |
| 2 |5|-| finished lab2 and homework; finished ass1 for D | make a mindmap for the knowledge structure of the lecture | time balance among other courses |
| 3 |4|-| finished homework and mindmap for the basic archive of the lecture | read *Big Java* chapter 2, pass the labtest1 and finish ass1 in HD ASAP | Too many reading materials from other courses may take up some spare time | |
| 4 |4|5| built a good mindmap structure; reviewed and conclude what i have learned in the course | read more example codes about O03 and O04 to get familiar with OOP | the fixed thinking pattern of progarmming C may affect the efficiency of programming with java |
| 5 |5|5| built the skeleton of ass2 | finish part one in ass2; complement the mindmap of lecture content; get some practice about class Arraylist<T>| difficulties in unstanding some concept about abstract |
| 6 |5|5| designed and optimized the structure of ass2 project; finished part one in ass2 | check and correct code style in ass2; continue to optimize project strcture; review recent lecture in break time | low effeciency on learning and applying new knowledge from internet |
| 7 |5|5| optimize the structure of ass2 with parent class of layers; read materials about searching algorithms for solving scoring function in ass2 | come up with an effetive and efficient solution for scoring in ass2; implement mouse event handle | prepare for lab test and other course's middle term exams |
| 8 |5|5| came up with the idea of implementing the scoring function for Tasks | complete the whole hirarchy for user mouse operation in ass2 | have to prepare for lab test and other course midterm exam |
| 9 |5|5| implement all mouse event for javafx UI | complete the whole game process | the complexity of out code become higher |
| 10 |5|5| beautified the UI in board and optimized classes properties | implement scoring methods | the complexity of the algorithms |
| 11 |5|5| implemented the computer component scene | combine the existing classes structure and scoring algorithm | time and space comsumption in scoring algorithm |
| 12 |5|5| prepared for the assignment 2 presentation | review for the final exam | None |
